## Insights from COVID-19 Data (South Africa, USA, India: 2020-2022)

Based on the exploratory data analysis of COVID-19 data for South Africa, the United States, and India, several key insights emerge:

1.  **Scale of the Pandemic:** The total burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, as measured by both total cases and total deaths, was significantly higher in the USA and India compared to South Africa during the 2020-2022 timeframe. The line plots for total cases and deaths clearly illustrate this difference in scale.

2.  **Vaccination Progress:** Examining the percentage of the population vaccinated over time reveals variations in the pace and overall coverage achieved by each country. [**Insert specific observation here, e.g., "The United States showed a rapid initial increase in the percentage of vaccinated individuals." or "India's vaccination drive gained significant momentum in the latter part of the period." or "South Africa's vaccination rate progressed at a certain pace relative to the others."**]

3.  **Distinct Infection Waves:** The daily new cases plot highlights multiple waves of COVID-19 infections in each country. The timing and intensity of these waves appear to differ, suggesting that the pandemic unfolded with its own dynamics in each context. For instance, [**mention a specific observation about the timing or height of a wave in one of the countries**].

4.  **Evolution of Death Rate:** The calculated death rate (total deaths / total cases) shows how the proportion of reported cases resulting in death evolved over time in each country. [**Describe any notable trends, such as a decrease in the death rate over time or significant differences in the average death rate between the countries.**]
