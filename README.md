## Insights from COVID-19 Data (South Africa, USA, India: 2020-2022)

Based on the exploratory data analysis of COVID-19 data for South Africa, the United States, and India, several key insights emerge:

1.  **Scale of the Pandemic:** The total burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, as measured by both total cases and total deaths, was significantly higher in the USA and India compared to South Africa during the 2020-2022 timeframe. The line plots for total cases and deaths clearly illustrate this difference in scale.

2.  **Vaccination Progress:** Examining the percentage of the population vaccinated over time reveals variations in the pace and overall coverage achieved by each country.
3.  **Distinct Infection Waves:** The daily new cases plot highlights multiple waves of COVID-19 infections in each country. The timing and intensity of these waves appear to differ, suggesting that the pandemic unfolded with its own dynamics in each context.
